# Notes:
# - This overlay expands coverage across axiomatic, computational, and empirical aspects
#   of approval voting and related social choice fields.
# - We weight multiwinner / committee-related terms to support outputs about
#   proportional approval and committee selection.
# - Keep formatting consistent with other Mathgen topic overlays: tokens and +weights.
